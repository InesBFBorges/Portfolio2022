			Hello 😃 😄 😁 😆 😊 😇 🙂 🙃 <br>
			My name is Inês and I am from Guimarães, Portugal. <br>
			I am a fan of Harry Potter and I plan to be a collector of magic wands. I am a very proud Hufflepuff! <br>
			I spend a lot of time in front of the computer learning and having fun with programming but I also like to watch comedy TV shows like The Big Bang Theory, Modern Family and The Neighbourhood. <br>
