			Hello 😃 😄 😁 😆 😊 😇 🙂 🙃 <br>
			My name <span class="vary-weight">is</span> Inês and I am from Guimarães, Portugal. <br>
			I am a fan of <span class="hufflepuff-text">Harry Potter</span> and I plan to be a collector <span class="vary-weight">of</span> magic wands. I am a very proud <span class="hufflepuff-text hufflepuff-color">Hufflepuff</span>! <br>
			I spend a lot of time <span class="vary-weight">in</span> front of the computer learning and having fun with programming <span class="vary-weight">but</span> I also like to watch comedy TV shows like The <span class="vary-weight">Big</span> Bang Theory, Modern Family and The Neighbourhood. <br>
			After I finished highschool <span class="vary-weight">I</span> spent one year <span class="vary-weight">in</span> university doing the cour<span class="vary-weight">s</span>e Material Engineering. <br>
			After that I decided to <span class="vary-weight">go</span> to France and was there studying French <span class="vary-weight">for</span> seven months. <br>
			Then I returned <span class="vary-weight">to</span> Portugal and went working as a catering employee <span class="vary-weight">at</span> Pizza Hut and Tomatino. <br>
			Although life <span class="vary-weight">was</span> hard back then, <span class="vary-weight">I</span> din't give up and went to England <span class="vary-weight">to</span> work at Tesco, a food warehouse. <br>
			But <span class="vary-weight">I</span> wasn't happy there <span class="vary-weight">so</span> I went back to Portugal and enrolled <span class="vary-weight">in</span> a CET which is the equivalent <span class="vary-weight">of</span> a Bachelor's Degree in Programming <span class="vary-weight">and</span> Informational Systems. <br>
			I excelled <span class="vary-weight">at</span> that course and started <span class="vary-weight">an</span> internship in the company <span class="vary-weight">I</span> am currently working in. <br>
			After three months <span class="vary-weight">I</span> signed a contract with <span class="vary-weight">my</span> current company and have <span class="vary-weight">been</span> working there ever since. <br>
			My plans <span class="vary-weight">for</span> the future are to take <span class="vary-weight">a</span> graduation on an IT course like Informatical Engineering <span class="vary-weight">and</span> maybe pursue the areas of Blockchain <span class="vary-weight">and</span> Artificial Intelligence. <br>
			To achieve that <span class="vary-weight">I</span> am gaining experience working <span class="vary-weight">a</span> remote job as a Programmer <span class="vary-weight">and</span> I am trying to enter university.
