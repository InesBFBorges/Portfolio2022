			Hello 😃 😄 😁 😆 😊 😇 🙂 🙃 <br>
			My name is Inês and I am from Guimarães, Portugal. <br>
			I am a fan of Harry Potter and I plan to be a collector of magic wands. I am a very proud Hufflepuff! <br>
			I spend a lot of time in front of the computer learning and having fun with programming but I also like to watch comedy TV shows like The Big Bang Theory, Modern Family and The Neighbourhood. <br>
			After I finished highschool I spent one year in university doing the course Material Engineering. <br>
			After that I deided to go to France and was there studying French for seven months. <br>
			Then I returned to Portugal and went working as a catering employee at Pizza Hut and Tomatino. <br>
			Although life was hard back then, I din't give up and went to England to work at Tesco, a food wharehouse. <br>
			But I wasn't happy there so I went back to Portugal and enrolled in a CET which is the equivalent of a Bachelor's Degree in Programming and Informational Systems. <br>
			I excelled at the course and started an internship in the company I am currently working in. <br>
			After three months I signed a contract with my current company and have been working there since then. <br>
			My plans for the futura are to take a graduation on an IT course like Informatical Engineering and maybe pursue the areas of Blockchain and Artificial Intelligence. <br>
			To achieve that I gain experience working a remote job as a Programmer and I will try to enter university.
